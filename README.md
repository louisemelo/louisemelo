## About

A developer passionate about technology and challenges (by the way, I'm motivated by them). I've worked with development for about 10 years and throughout this time I've been through many different scenarios and learned a lot from them!  
  
I have worked with customer support in the financial field on various applications on several platforms and technologies. Client negotiation about requirements, deadlines and qualities. Most of the time, I worked allocated in a bank, which allowed me to acquire huge knowledge in this area (business and technology).  
  
I've also worked in education. It was different from the environments I had worked in before. It was a great experience where I learned new technologies and I could get to know many different professionals and cultures, since I used to work from home.  
  
Another experience I had as a developer was in a car rental company. It was a big challenge as I worked directly with the company's call center.  
  
Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at XP Inc, an important investment corporation.  
  
My biggest goal today is to develop more and more of my leadership skills.  
  
Besides technology, God, family, music and pets are my passions! (:
